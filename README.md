# Dynamic-Feedback-Lineariz-diff-robot-tracking
A Dynamic Feedback Linearization for a differential wheeled robot for tracking any continous trajectory in plane with asymptotic stability.

Learning this topic, I just programed this to watch it's effectivity in a very particular case (wheeled robot).
DFL is really useful when you have at least two inputs. It is useless in case of one input, being the same as classic Feedback Linearization, or "Static" Feedback Linearization. Further reading in folder "References"
